        <h3 class="faq-title">Do Aliens Exist?</h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
          The short answer is we don't know. We don't have any proof to state
          that aliens do exist, but we also don't have any proof to state that
          they do not. While we know there are planets orbiting stars at the
          right distance for liquid water to exist, we have no idea if there is
          any form of life beyond our planet.

        <h3 class="faq-title">Why Is the Ocean Blue?</h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
          The ocean looks blue because red, orange and yellow (long wavelength
          light) are absorbed more strongly by water than is blue (short
          wavelength light). So when white light from the sun enters the ocean,
          it is mostly the blue that gets returned. Same reason the sky is blue.

        <h3 class="faq-title">What Makes a Rainbow Curved?</h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
          A rainbow is curved because it reflects the round shape of the sun.
          Because you are on Earth, part of the sun is blocked, which why
          rainbows appear as a half or a quarter circle. If you were in an
          airplane and saw a rainbow below you, it would appear as a full
          circle.

        <h3 class="faq-title">Why Is Water Wet?</h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
          The feeling of wetness is actually coldness. You can test this by
          comparing water with another liquid such as cooking oil, which doesn't
          evaporate so freely. Fill two small cups: one with water, and the
          other with cooking oil. (Young children should ask an adult to help.)
          Let both liquids come to room temperature for a day, or overnight. Dip
          one index finger in each liquid, lift them out, and then observe for a
          few minutes.
