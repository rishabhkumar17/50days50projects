        <h1>Black Holes, explained</h1>
        <small>Source: google</Source></small>
        <p>
          A black hole is a region of space in which gravity exerts such an
          enormous pull that nothing—not even light—can escape. That’s the
          simple definition of a black hole. But if you talk to a physicist,
          they’ll also describe a black hole as a region of very severely curved
          space-time—so sharply curved, in fact, that it’s “pinched off,” so to
          speak, from the rest of the universe. This idea of curved space-time
          goes back to the work of Einstein. It was just over 100 years ago that
          Einstein put forward his theory of gravity, known as the general
          theory of relativity. According to the theory, matter curves, or
          distorts, the very fabric of space. A small object like Earth causes
          only a small amount of distortion; a star like our Sun causes more
          warping. And what about a very heavy, dense object? According to
          Einstein’s theory, if you squeeze enough mass into a small-enough
          space, it will undergo a collapse, forming a black hole; the amount of
          warping will become infinite. The boundary of the black hole is known
          as the “event horizon”—the point of no return. Matter that crosses the
          event horizon can never return to the outside. In this sense, the
          inside of a black hole is not even a part of our universe: Whatever
          might be happening there, we can never know about, since no signal
          from the inside can ever reach the outside. According to general
          relativity, the center of a black hole will contain a “singularity”—a
          point of infinite density and of infinitely curved space-time.
